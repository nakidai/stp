Simple web api for converting svg to png. I use it as just useful way to render
svg images in discord, because it can't to it itself.

Usage

For example you have svg image at `https://example.com/image.svg`.

Run application, and then follow the link like this:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/?link=https://example.com/image.svg
```

And voila, you've just got the png image!
